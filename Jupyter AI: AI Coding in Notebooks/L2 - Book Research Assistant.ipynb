    "You can repeat steps 1-3 to define a second tool for the book research assistant, so it can handle more complex book queries.\n",

    "1. In the chat interface, attach the file containing the API documentation of Open Library (`openlibrary_api_docs.md`) and use a prompt like this:\n",
    "   > Write a code cell that uses Open Library's works endpoint to retrieve information about a book, based on the work's key that has this format: \"/works/{work_id}\". The result should include: title, description, subjects (limit to 10), first_sentence, covers (limit to 3). Print the returned results. Use the documentation for Open Library's API provided above.\n",
    "2. In the chat interface, create the function tool using a prompt like this:\n",
    "   > Wrap the code above in a function `get_book_details`:\n",
    "   > - Function argument: `work_key` in this format: `/works/{work_id}`\n",
    "   > - Output: JSON string with: title, description, subjects (limit to 10), first_sentence, covers (limit to 3)\n",
    "   >  - Write good docstring\n",
    "3. Update the `chat_with_tools` function to include the second tool as follows:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ``` python\n",
    "   response = client.chat.completions.create(\n",
