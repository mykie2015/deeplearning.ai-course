    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- How to build flows using the CrewAI CLI\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As a research consultant, you're constantly tasked with producing comprehensive reports on diverse topics for demanding clients. You need to build an AI research crew that can rapidly gather, verify, and synthesize information from across the internet, delivering reliable, fact-checked reports that meet tight deadlines and exacting standards regardless of the subject matter.\n",

    "## General instructions\n",
    "In this lab you will be presented with a structure of the code, but you will need to complete some of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully run this lab, replace all instances of the placeholder `None` with your own code. Sections where you need to write code will be delimited between `### START CODE HERE ###` and `### END CODE HERE ###`.\n",

    "In this lab, you will learn how to build a flow, which includes the deep research crew you created in the last lab. \n",

    "If you were to create the flow from scratch, you can do so by running the following command on a terminal: \n",

    "Just as you did with the Crew in the previous lab, to build a flow you need to create a Flow object, inside which you will define all the tasks it needs to run, and interconnect them using  decorators. This object is created in the [`src/deep_research_flow/main.py`](deep_research_flow/src/deep_research_flow/main.py) file. This main file looks a bit different from the one for crews, but you will be able to complete it by the end of the lab. \n",
