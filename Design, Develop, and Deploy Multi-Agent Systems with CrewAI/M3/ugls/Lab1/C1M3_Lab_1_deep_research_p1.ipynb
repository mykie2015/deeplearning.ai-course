    "# Automatic Deep Research  - Adding coordination patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first practice lab of this module! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will continue working on the deep research crew from Modules 1 and 2. This time you will be taking the crew one step further by adding coordination patterns.\n",

    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- How to create a crew using the CrewAI CLI\n",
    "- How to design agent teams using different coordination strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As a research consultant, you're constantly tasked with producing comprehensive reports on diverse topics for demanding clients. You need to build an AI research crew that can rapidly gather, verify, and synthesize information from across the internet, delivering reliable, fact-checked reports that meet tight deadlines and exacting standards regardless of the subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "In this lab you will be presented with a structure of the code, but you will need to complete some of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully run this lab, replace all instances of the placeholder `None` with your own code. Sections where you need to write code will be delimited between `### START CODE HERE ###` and `### END CODE HERE ###`.\n",

    "In this lab, you will not only be learning how to add coordination patterns, you will also learn a new way to define crews, using CrewAI CLI. The CLI provides a set of commands to interact with CrewAI, allowing you to create, train, run, and manage crews. At the end of the day, it is just a different way of doing the things you've been doing so far, but it makes it easier to use your Crew in production later on.\n",

    "Let's do a little walkthrough of the different files and folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`knowledge/user_preference.txt`](deep_research_crew/knowledge/user_preference.txt): This is one of the template files. Here you can add knowledge to your crew. You learned about knowledge on Module 2 of this course.\n",
    "- [`src/deep_research_crew/config`](deep_research_crew/src/deep_research_crew/config/): This folder contains the YAML configuration files for agents and tasks. This is equivalent to the files you used in the previous module. You will be working on the `tasks.yaml` file later in the lab\n",
    "- [`src/deep_research_crew/tools`](deep_research_crew/src/deep_research_crew/tools/): You should use this folder to define custom tools if needed. You can write your custom Python  code in the [`custom_tool.py`](deep_research_crew/src/deep_research_crew/tools/custom_tool.py) file, but you won't be working on this here.\n",
    "- [`src/deep_research_crew/crew.py`](deep_research_crew/src/deep_research_crew/crew.py): In this file you will define the agents and tasks, and the crew. This is similar to what you have been doing in the previous labs. This file has been partially filled out for you, you will complete it later on in this lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Take close look at the code, and the use of decorators, which are statements starting with `@`. You will not need to modify them in this lab, but it is good that you start getting used to them. \n",
    "- [`src/deep_research_crew/main.py`](deep_research_crew/src/deep_research_crew/main.py): This file file is intended to be a way for your to run your crew locally. You can use it to test the crew by replacing with the desired inputs. This file is just the default generated by the `crewai create crew deep_research_crew` command, and you won't be making any changes to it.\n",
    "- [`pyproject.toml`](deep_research_crew/pyproject.toml): This is a configuration file that defines build system requirements, dependencies, and metadata for the Python project, enabling standardized packaging and tool integration. As you can see, in this case there are some extra packages, which you need for the tools, both custom and built-in. You won't be making any changes to this file.\n",
