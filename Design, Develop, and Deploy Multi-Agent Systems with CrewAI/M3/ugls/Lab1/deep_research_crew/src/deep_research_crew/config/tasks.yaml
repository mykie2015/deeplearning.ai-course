# Define the task to create the research plan.
# This task involves breaking down the user query into main and secondary topics.
create_research_plan:
  description: >
    Break down the research query "{user_query}" into MAIN topics (core
    essential areas) and SECONDARY topics (supporting areas). Clearly separate and
    prioritize these categories for parallel research execution.
  expected_output: >
    A research plan with: 1) MAIN TOPICS: Core research areas crucial
    for answering the query, 2) SECONDARY TOPICS: Supporting research areas that provide
    context, 3) Key questions for each topic category, 4) Research priorities and
    success criteria

# Define the task to research main topics.
research_main_topics:
  description: >
    Using the research plan, focus on the MAIN topics and search the internet
    to collect comprehensive information. Verify information across multiple sources
    and cite all sources used.
  expected_output: >
    Comprehensive research data for MAIN topics including: 1) Detailed
    information for each main research topic with citations, 2) Key facts and statistics,
    3) Multiple source perspectives, 4) Source credibility notes

  expected_output: >
    Comprehensive research data for SECONDARY topics including: 1)
    Supporting information for each secondary research topic with citations, 2) Contextual
    facts and background, 3) Multiple source perspectives, 4) Source credibility notes

    Review all collected MAIN topic research data for accuracy and consistency.
    Identify any conflicting information, potential misinformation, or gaps that need
    addressing. Flag areas requiring human review if needed.
  expected_output: >
    Main topics quality assessment report with all the original information you got.
    Include numbers we can use to plot chart plus: 
    1) Verified facts vs. questionable information, 2) Consistency check results,
    3) Source reliability ratings, 4) Approval for final report generation. Make sure this
    is as comprehensive as possible for final report generation'

# Define the task to write the final report.
write_final_report:
  description: >
    Create a comprehensive report that answers the original query "{user_query}"
    using all validated research data from both MAIN and SECONDARY topic branches.
    Structure it with clear sections, include citations, and provide actionable insights.
    Use the custom tool to create intuitive charts based on the verified information. 
    Include the generated charts into the final report, any chart should be loadded from the deep_research_crew/plots/ path, so you just append the file name after that'

  expected_output: >
    A final research report containing: 1) Executive summary, 2) Detailed
    findings that answer the user query using main topics, 3) Supporting context from
    secondary topics, 4) Complete source citations, 5) Key insights and recommendations.
    Must include Summary, Insights/Recommendations, and Citations sections.
    Whenever possible, include the charts inside the report'
