    "# Module 3 Assignment: Building an Automatic Code Review Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Module 3's assignment! In this lab, you use the Automatic Code Review crew from Modules 1 and 2 and, with some modifications, create a CrewAI Flow that embeds it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Naturally, not all code changes warrant a full agentic review; sometimes it's small fixes, like indentation or fixing typos. In order to avoid wasting resources and time, you will create a Flow that analyzes the depth of the changes and deploys the Crew only if needed. You will also add some parallelism into the tasks of the Crew itself to make things more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, you had created an amazing Automatic Code Review Crew. In this lab, you will use the CrewAI CLI to incorporate this Crew as one of the tasks in a Flow. You will also be improving the performance of the Crew by making some tasks run in parallel, improving the execution time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## General instructions for grading\n",
    "- Replace all `None` instances with your own solution.\n",
    "- You can add new cells to experiment, but these will be omitted by the grader. Only use the provided cells for your solution code.\n",
    "- Before submitting, make sure all the cells in your lab work correctly.\n",
    "- **Do not change variable names**: if you modify variable names, the grader won't be able to find your solutions\n",
    "- **Use the provided configuration**: for grading, please use all provided configurations. Don't change the configuration files or settings. You can experiment after submitting your lab.\n",
    "- To submit your notebook, save it and then click on the red **Submit Assignment** button at the top right of the page.\n",

    "## 1. Getting familiar with the Flow structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will build a CrewAI Flow, by completing the different files in the Flow file structure. You should see a folder named `code_review_flow` with the following structure:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is a brief explanation of the role of each of the files and folders:\n",
    "- `src/`: Contains all the files needed to define the flow\n",
    "- `src/code_review_flow/crews/`: In here you can define as many crews as needed for your flow. In this case, you only have the `code_review_crew`\n",
    "    - `src/code_review_flow/crews/code_review_crew/config`: This folder contains the [`agents.yaml`](code_review_flow/src/code_review_flow/crews/code_review_crew/config/agents.yaml) and [`tasks.yaml`](code_review_flow/src/code_review_flow/crews/code_review_crew/config/tasks.yaml) files you are already familiar with. These help you configure the tasks and agents for the crew. \n",
    "    - `src/code_review_flow/crews/code_review_crew/guardrails/`: This folder contains the [`guardrails.py`](code_review_flow/src/code_review_flow/crews/code_review_crew/guardrails/guardrails.py) file, with the guardrails defined for the crew. \n",
    "    - [`src/code_review_flow/crews/code_review_crew/crew.py`](code_review_flow/src/code_review_flow/crews/code_review_crew/crew.py): This is the file where you create the crew, assigning it the agents, tasks, along with any additional configuration to these elements.\n",
    "- [`src/code_review_flow/main.py`](code_review_flow/src/code_review_flow/main.py): In this file you will get to define the Flow object, inside which you will define all the tasks it needs to run, and interconnect them with the help of decorators.\n"

In fact, you won't need to make any changes to the [`agents.yaml`](code_review_flow/src/code_review_flow/crews/code_review_crew/config/agents.yaml) file. You will, however, make some adaptations to the tasks. \n",

    "2. The next step consists of an LLM call to decide whether the changes are small or if a full analysis is needed. This is a router step, because it can select between two different routes.\n",
    "3. Based on the decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. If the changes are simple enough, the Simple Review is executed, and an LLM call is used to decide whether the changes are good to be accepted or if other measures are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. If the changes are more complex, the workload is delegated to the Crew for a deep analysis of the code and possible security issues.\n",
    "4. However the PR was analyzed, the next step is to make the final decision. For this, the output of step 3 is passed to an LLM call to make the final decision.\n",
    "5. After the final decision is made, an answer is returned to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another cool thing about Flows is that they allow you to define a state, which is the record of its current progress, inputs, intermediate outputs, and decisions made during execution. You can decide what messages, variables, or values you want to save there."
