      "question": "If James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week, how many pages does he write in 52 weeks?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: First, I need to determine how many pages James writes in one week.\nStep 2: James writes 3 pages to 2 friends twice a week, so he writes 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 pages per week.\nStep 3: To find out how many pages he writes in a year, I need to multiply the number of pages he writes per week by the number of weeks in a year (52).\nStep 4: So, the total number of pages James writes in a year is 12 * 52.",

      "question": "If Mark has 10 yellow flowers and there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, and there are 25% as many green flowers as yellow and purple flowers combined, how many flowers does Mark have?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: First, I need to calculate the number of purple flowers.\nStep 2: Since there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, the number of purple flowers is 10 + (10 * 0.8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\nStep 3: Next, I need to find the total number of yellow and purple flowers combined, which is 10 + 18 = 28.\nStep 4: Then, I need to calculate the number of green flowers, which is 25% of 28, or 0.25 * 28 = 7.\nStep 5: Finally, I add the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers to get the total number of flowers Mark has: 10 + 18 + 7.",

      "question": "If Tobias has been saving $5 allowance each month for 3 months and charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel a driveway, and he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel if he has $95 to buy shoes and has $15 left after the purchase?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: First, I need to determine how much money Tobias saved from his allowance: 3 * $5 = $15.\nStep 2: Then, I need to calculate how much he earned from mowing lawns: 4 * $15 = $60.\nStep 3: Tobias spent $95 on shoes and had $15 left, so he had $95 + $15 = $110 before buying the shoes.\nStep 4: The total amount he earned from mowing lawns and his allowance is $60 + $15 = $75.\nStep 5: To find out how much he earned from shoveling driveways, I subtract $75 from $110, which gives $35.\nStep 6: Finally, I divide $35 by $7 to find out how many driveways he shoveled.",

      "question": "If a deep-sea monster consumes 847 people over 300 years and each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Let's denote the number of people on the first ship as x.\nStep 2: Then, the number of people on the second ship is 2x, and on the third ship is 2 * 2x = 4x.\nStep 3: The total number of people consumed over 300 years is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.\nStep 4: We are given that 7x = 847, so we need to solve for x.\nStep 5: Dividing 847 by 7 gives x.",
