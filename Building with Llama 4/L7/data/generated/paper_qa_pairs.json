  "summary": "The document introduces the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level LLM architecture that matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale while improving inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, allocating more compute to complex data. The model comprises three modules: a local encoder, a global latent transformer, and a local decoder. BLT achieves training flop-controlled parity with Llama 3 while using up to 50% fewer flops at inference and demonstrates improved robustness to input noise and character-level understanding.",
