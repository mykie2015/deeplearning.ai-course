  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nMeta AI has released the Llama 4 series, a new generation of multimodal AI models that offer unprecedented context length support and are built using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. The Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick models are the first open-weight natively multimodal models, with 17 billion active parameters and outperforming previous models in various benchmarks. The models were trained using a new technique called MetaP and a large dataset of over 30 trillion tokens, and were distilled from a larger teacher model, Llama 4 Behemoth. The release of Llama 4 marks a new era for the Llama ecosystem, enabling developers to build more personalized and intelligent experiences. The models are available for download on llama.com and Hugging Face.",
